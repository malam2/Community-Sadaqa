Below is an end-to-end, command-driven workflow to build your iOS-only MVP in VS Code (as your main editor) with GitHub Copilot doing most of the coding. You will still need Xcode for iOS build/signing/simulator, but you can keep day-to-day coding inside VS Code and build/run via terminal.

I’m going to assume: SwiftUI + Firebase (Auth + Firestore + optional FCM later), “mosque community = IOK Diamond Bar” hardcoded for MVP, anonymous posting toggle, moderation/reporting.

⸻

0) Prereqs (one-time)

Install Xcode + command line tools
	•	Install Xcode from App Store
	•	Then run:

xcode-select --install

Install VS Code + GitHub Copilot extensions

In VS Code:
	•	Install GitHub Copilot
	•	Install GitHub Copilot Chat
	•	Install Swift extension (and “Swift Language Support / SourceKit-LSP” if available)

Install tooling via Homebrew

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

brew update
brew install git swiftlint swiftformat
brew install tuist

Why Tuist? It makes iOS projects reproducible and easy to generate/build from terminal while you code in VS Code.

⸻

1) Create repo + project skeleton (commands)

mkdir iok-sadaqa
cd iok-sadaqa
git init
gh repo create iok-sadaqa --private --source=. --remote=origin --push

Create a basic README:

cat > README.md <<'EOF'
# IOK Sadaqa (iOS)
Mosque-centered community help app (nonprofit, sadaqa). MVP: iOS-only, English-only.
EOF


⸻

2) Generate an iOS app project with Tuist

Initialize Tuist

tuist init --platform ios

This creates a Tuist project. Now generate Xcode workspace:

tuist generate

Open the folder in VS Code:

code .

And open the generated workspace in Xcode (for simulator runs/signing):

open *.xcworkspace


⸻

3) Add Firebase via Swift Package Manager (SPM)

You will add Firebase packages inside Xcode (one-time), then code mainly in VS Code:

In Xcode:
	•	Project → Package Dependencies → Add
	•	Add Firebase iOS SDK package:
	•	https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk
	•	Select:
	•	FirebaseAuth
	•	FirebaseFirestore
	•	(Optional later: FirebaseMessaging for push)

Then in Firebase Console:
	•	Create a Firebase project
	•	Add iOS app (bundle id must match your app)
	•	Download GoogleService-Info.plist
	•	Drag it into your app target in Xcode

⸻

4) Turn VS Code + Copilot into your “app builder”

VS Code settings (recommended)

Create .vscode/settings.json:

mkdir -p .vscode
cat > .vscode/settings.json <<'EOF'
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "github.copilot.enable": {
    "*": true,
    "plaintext": false
  }
}
EOF


⸻

5) Use this architecture (Copilot will implement it)

You’ll build with a clean separation:
	•	App/ : entry point, environment objects
	•	Features/Auth/ : Apple/Google sign-in + session state
	•	Features/Feed/ : list posts + filters
	•	Features/Post/ : create request/offer + anonymous toggle
	•	Features/Chat/ : optional MVP v1.1
	•	Core/Models/ : UserProfile, Post, Report
	•	Core/Services/ : AuthService, FirestoreService, ModerationService
	•	Core/UI/ : components (cards, chips, bottom sheets)

⸻

6) Copilot “Commands” (use Copilot Chat exactly like this)

Open Copilot Chat and run these prompts in order. These are designed to be copy/paste “build commands” for Copilot.

6.1 Create the base app shell + navigation

Copilot Chat Prompt 1:

Create a SwiftUI iOS app named “IOKSadaqa”. Use MVVM + services. Create a TabView with 3 tabs: Feed, Create, Profile. Add a floating “Create” button on Feed as well. Use modern interactive UI: animated transitions, matchedGeometryEffect for expanding a post card into a detail sheet, haptics on key actions. Create folder structure: App, Core, Features (Auth, Feed, Post, Profile). Provide code files accordingly.

6.2 Define models

Prompt 2:

Create Core/Models for:
	•	UserProfile: id, displayName, email, communityId, createdAt
	•	Community: id, name, city, state (MVP hardcode IOK Diamond Bar)
	•	Post: id, communityId, type(request/offer), category, title, description, isAnonymous, authorId, authorDisplayName (optional), createdAt, status(open/fulfilled), urgent(bool), contactPreference(inAppOnly/phone/other)
	•	Report: id, postId, reporterId, reason, createdAt
Include Codable, Firestore mapping helpers, and enum raw values.

6.3 Firebase bootstrap

Prompt 3:

Implement Firebase initialization in App entry. Create FirestoreService with CRUD for posts: createPost, fetchPosts(communityId, filters), updatePostStatus, reportPost. Implement paging and real-time updates using Firestore listeners. Add caching and optimistic UI updates.

6.4 Auth with Apple + Google (simple)

Prompt 4:

Implement AuthService using FirebaseAuth with Sign in with Apple and Google. Create a SessionStore ObservableObject with states: unauthenticated, authenticating, authenticated(user). On first login, create UserProfile in Firestore with communityId default = “iok_diamond_bar”. Keep email private. Add “Continue as Anonymous Poster” toggle for posts (not anonymous auth session).

6.5 Feed UI (very interactive)

Prompt 5:

Build Feed UI:
	•	Top filter chips: Request/Offer, Category, Urgent, Open/Fulfilled
	•	Post cards with subtle animations, swipe actions (Fulfilled, Report), long-press to preview
	•	Tap expands card into detail view (matched geometry) with “Offer Help / I Can Help” button
	•	Add search bar and sorting (Newest, Urgent first)
Keep it clean and modern.

6.6 Create Post flow (request/offer + anonymous toggle)

Prompt 6:

Build Create Post flow: segmented control Request vs Offer, category picker, title + description, urgent toggle, anonymous toggle (explains “name hidden to community”), contact preference, preview screen, publish button with progress state + error handling. Enforce legal-safe categories by allowing only these categories: Food, Baby Supplies, Ride, Essentials, Consulting/Advice, Temporary Shelter, Other (with warning). Add disclaimer text and require user to accept “No illegal requests/services” checkbox before publishing.

6.7 Moderation + reporting

Prompt 7:

Implement reporting: user can report a post with reason (Scam, Illegal, Harassment, Other). Store in Firestore collection “reports”. Add basic moderation rules: if post receives >=3 unique reports, auto-hide it (status = hidden) until admin review. Add an Admin view (only for a hardcoded list of admin UIDs in config) to review reports and restore/delete posts.

6.8 Profile + settings

Prompt 8:

Build Profile tab: user info, community fixed to IOK Diamond Bar (MVP), notification preferences placeholder, guidelines page, privacy policy placeholder, logout. Add a “My Posts” list with edit status (mark fulfilled).

⸻

7) Add a “Copilot-driven” task runner in your repo

Create a Makefile to standardize build/lint/format from terminal:

cat > Makefile <<'EOF'
APP_SCHEME=App

.PHONY: generate build test lint format

generate:
	tuist generate

build:
	xcodebuild -workspace *.xcworkspace -scheme $(APP_SCHEME) -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' build

test:
	xcodebuild -workspace *.xcworkspace -scheme $(APP_SCHEME) -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' test

lint:
	swiftlint

format:
	swiftformat .
EOF

Now you can run:

make generate
make build


⸻

8) Firestore rules (minimum viable safety)

In Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules, use something like:
	•	Only authenticated users can read/write posts in their community
	•	Only author can update their own post status
	•	Reports allowed by any authenticated user
	•	Admin-only delete/restore actions

Copilot Chat Prompt 9 (rules):

Write Firestore security rules for collections: users, posts, reports. Ensure:
	•	Only authenticated users can read posts for their own communityId
	•	Only author can update their post fields except status=hidden (admin/mod only)
	•	Any user can create a report but cannot edit/delete reports
	•	Admin users are hardcoded by UID list in rules for MVP

(Then paste the generated rules into Firebase Console.)

⸻

9) Run the app (terminal + Xcode)

Generate workspace:

make generate

Build:

make build

Run in Simulator:
	•	easiest: click Run in Xcode
	•	or via command line:

xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 15" || true
open -a Simulator


⸻

10) What “interactive UI” should mean for your MVP (features checklist)

Make sure Copilot implements these (and you review):
	•	Smooth feed scrolling with skeleton loading
	•	Filter chips with animated selection
	•	Card → detail expansion using matchedGeometryEffect
	•	Bottom sheet for report reasons
	•	Swipe actions on cards (fulfill/report)
	•	Haptics on publish / fulfill / offer-help
	•	Empty states (no posts yet) with guidance text
	•	“Anonymous” badge on posts and a privacy explanation

⸻

11) If you want “end-to-end Copilot automation” even harder

Use Copilot Chat like a “scaffold generator”:

Prompt 10:

Create a step-by-step commit plan. For each step, list files created/modified. Then generate code for step 1 only. After that, wait for “next” to generate step 2. Keep each step buildable.

This prevents Copilot from dumping too much at once and keeps your repo consistently compiling.

⸻

If you want, I can also provide:
	•	A ready-made data schema (Firestore collections + indexes)
	•	A “no-scams” safety design (rate limits, identity friction, trusted volunteers)
	•	A simple onboarding flow specifically for IOK Diamond Bar posters/announcements (QR code + “community code” approach)

Tell me if you want messaging/chat in the MVP (v1.0) or as the next milestone (v1.1).
